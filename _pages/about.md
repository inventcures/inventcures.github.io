Hi ! I am __ashish__, but go by __tp53__ 

{ Read more about the tp53 gene [here](https://stetson.substack.com/p/the-tumor-suppressor-to-rule-them) & at wikipedia [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53) }

As you can probably already tell, i am extremely passionate(some would say obsessed :D !) with all things cancer & oncology - spanning cancer genomics, ml accelerated protein design &drug discovery, clinical trials, radiation oncology treatment planning, to palliative care.
Finding drugs & therapies for cancer (& other diseases, especially rare genetic disorders &  aggressive cancers like GBM, etc)

I trained as an engineer during my undergrad and then got a masters in computer engineering at Purdue(Hail Purdue !)
However in the last 7-8 years, a variety of experiences in the family, and encounters with patients, doctors and life-changing books have inspired me to pursue a career at the intersection of tech(ml) & medicine-biology, especially cancer.

My north star - guiding mission in everything i do professionally(which i discovered rather late in life) is to impact medicine & disease, by :

1. __Building tools & systems, for drug discovery, at the interface of ml + biology__ : Develop systems & tools to accelerate discovery of  new drugs (which often takes of the order of decades, and still may fail in clinical trials or in the market), especially for cancers, for which no good therapies exists today
2. __Building tools & systems, at the interface of ml + medicine/healthcare__ : Use the vast amount of biomedical data & ml/ai, to design systems, to __help__ :

  a. amplify productivity of clinicians by __helping them make clinical decisions better, faster, cheaper__.

  b. __patients become more engaged & involved in their care__, customized to their __custom medical literacy level & native language__.

2. 
__One of my all time fav reads, on any topic__

One of the most inspiring stories i ahve read, a true hero, Matt Might.
Matt is an accomplished CS professor, and suddenly, their young son has strange symptoms, which no doctor can diagnose.
The post chronicles, the diagnostic odyssey, typical of many rare disease families.
And how Matt & his wife, drop everything and dive head first, to try to find a drug/therapy, for their son, Bertrand.

[Hunting down my son's killer by Matt Might](https://matt.might.net/articles/my-sons-killer/)

[Unfortunately, Bertrand passed away in 2020.
Here is a poignant piece by Matt Might, reflecting on Bertrand's life & legacy](https://bertrand.might.net/articles/echoes-of-bertrand/)

__Some other pieces by Matt, that i keep going back to, and have forced me to reflect & introspect on my life & relationships :__

[a. Accepting the unacceptable](https://bertrand.might.net/articles/accepting-the-unacceptable/)


[b. The algorithm for precision medicine](https://bertrand.might.net/articles/algorithm-for-precision-medicine/)

3. __Another inspiring story of Rohan & Jen Seth's daughter Lydia__

[Also recommend the wonderfully researched book, Breath From Salt by Bijal P. Trivedi
Very detailed, & at 615 pages, will take a while to read, but one gets a ringside view of the effort to find a drug/therapy for CF](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Breath-From-Salt)

[Goodreads reviews](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53847362-breath-from-salt)


__2 more books on rare disease, i really enjoyed !!! (both much shorter than Breath from Salt :D)__

[Chasing my cure by David Fajgenbaum](https://chasingmycure.com/about/)

[We the scientists by WSJ Pulitzer prize winning reprter, Amy Dockser Marcus](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/537125/we-the-scientists-by-amy-dockser-marcus/)





__What do i do for leisure__
When i am not working - i enjoy long walks/runs, drinking chai, riding my bike(bicycle), watching (& someday performing ?) standup comedy, attending music performances & theatre, and spending time with family. I used to volunteer a lot more, and want to get back to doing that more often.
