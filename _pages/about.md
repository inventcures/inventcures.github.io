Hi ! I am __ashish__, but go by __tp53__ 

{ Read more about the tp53 gene [here](https://stetson.substack.com/p/the-tumor-suppressor-to-rule-them) & at wikipedia [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53) }

As you can probably already tell, i am obsessed with finding drugs & therapies for cancer (& other diseases, especially rare genetic disorders & rare, aggressive cancers like GBM, etc)

I trained as an engineer during my undergrad and then got a masters in computer engineering at Purdue(Hail Purdue !)
However in the last 7-8 years, a variety of experiences in the family, and encounters with patients, doctors and life-changing books have inspired me to pursue a career at the intersection of tech(ml) & medicine-biology, especially cancer.

My purpose in life(which i discovered rather late in life) is to impact medicine & disease, by :

1. __Longer-term__ : Develop systems & tools to accelerate discovery of  new drugs (which often takes of the order of decades, and still may fail in clinical trials or in the market), especially for cancers, for which no good therapies exists today
2. __Immediate term__ : Use the vast amount of biomedical data & ml/ai, to design systems, to __help__ :

  a. amplify productivity of clinicians by __helping them make clinical decisions better, faster, cheaper__.

  b. __patients become more engaged & involved in their care__, customized to their __custom medical literacy level & native language__.


When i am not working - i enjoy long walks/runs, drinking chai, riding my bike(bicycle), watching (& someday performing ?) standup comedy, attending music performances & theatre, and spending time with family. I used to volunteer a lot more, and want to get back to doing that more often.
