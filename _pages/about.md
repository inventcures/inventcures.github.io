# Hi, I'm Ashish

I go by **tp53** online, named after the [tumor suppressor gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53) that's central to cancer research. To learn more about tp53, I highly recommend this very accessible (even to laymen!) [substack post](https://stetson.substack.com/p/the-tumor-suppressor-to-rule-them) by [Stetson Thacker](https://x.com/stetson_thacker) on tp53, the tumor suppressor to rule them all, often also christened "the guardian of the genome".

I'm an engineer passionate about accelerating drug discovery and building tools at the intersection of machine learning and medicine. My focus is on cancer and oncology - from genomics and protein design to clinical trials and treatment planning.

## What I'm working on

My mission is to impact medicine and disease through technology:

**Building tools for drug discovery** - Developing systems to accelerate the discovery of new therapeutics, especially for cancers where good treatments don't exist today.

**Building tools for healthcare** - Using AI and biomedical data to help clinicians make better decisions faster, and to help patients become more engaged in their care.

See my [projects](/projects/) for details on computational protein design, bio ML challenges, and regulatory analysis work.

## Background

I trained as an engineer during undergrad and got my Master's in Computer Engineering at Purdue. Over the past several years, personal experiences and encounters with patients and doctors have inspired me to pursue a career at the intersection of tech and medicine.
