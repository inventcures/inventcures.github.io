# Hi, I'm Ashish

I go by **tp53** online, named after the [tumor suppressor gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53) that's central to cancer research.

I'm an engineer passionate about accelerating drug discovery and building tools at the intersection of machine learning and medicine. My focus is on cancer and oncology - from genomics and protein design to clinical trials and treatment planning.

## What I'm working on

My mission is to impact medicine and disease through technology:

**Building tools for drug discovery** - Developing systems to accelerate the discovery of new therapeutics, especially for cancers where good treatments don't exist today.

**Building tools for healthcare** - Using AI and biomedical data to help clinicians make better decisions faster, and to help patients become more engaged in their care.

## Computational Protein Design

I'm exploring computational approaches to protein and antibody design, working alongside [Dr. Anurag](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OGdnQkUAAAAJ&hl=en) at KCDH-A.

**Recent projects:**

- **CD20 Binder Design** - Participated in the [Bits to Binders 2024](https://github.com/inventcures/Bits_to_Binders_2024) challenge, designing computational binders targeting CD20 for B-cell lymphoma therapeutics.

- **Nipah Virus Binder** - Competing in the [Designing Therapeutics for Nipah Virus](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/designing-therapeutics-for-nipah-virus/overview) challenge using diffusion-based generative models including [BoltzGen](https://proteinbase.bio/profile/ashishdatta) for *de novo* binder design.

For a comprehensive overview of AI-driven antibody design, see this excellent [state-of-the-art review](https://www.booleanbiotech.com/p/ai-is-revolutionizing-antibody-engineering-part2).

## Background

I trained as an engineer during undergrad and got my Master's in Computer Engineering at Purdue. Over the past several years, personal experiences and encounters with patients and doctors have inspired me to pursue a career at the intersection of tech and medicine.
