## Interactive AACR 2025 Clinical Trial Results Visualization

I've created an interactive dashboard visualizing objective response rates from clinical trials reported at AACR 2025, featuring real data extracted from 12 clinical trial abstracts including breakthrough studies like KEYNOTE-689 (pembrolizumab in head & neck cancer), KEYLYNK-007 (olaparib + pembrolizumab tumor-agnostic trial), Dostarlimab non-operative management (81% ORR), and Zoldonrasib (KRAS G12D inhibitor with 61% ORR). The dashboard allows filtering by cancer type, trial phase, and company, with interactive tooltips providing detailed trial information including sample sizes ranging from 12 to 714 patients and response rates from 27% to 85.7% across multiple cancer types. This visualization is inspired by the excellent work at [aacr.convoke.bio](https://aacr.convoke.bio/) - thanks to Alex Telford for the inspiration!

### Key Features:
- **Real AACR 2025 Data**: 12 clinical trials with comprehensive metadata
- **Interactive Filtering**: By cancer type, trial phase, and pharmaceutical company
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Detailed Tooltips**: Hover over data points for complete trial information

### Featured Trials:
- **KEYNOTE-689**: Pembrolizumab in head & neck cancer (Phase 3, N=714)
- **Dostarlimab**: Non-operative management of MMRd tumors (Phase 2, ORR=81%)
- **Zoldonrasib**: KRAS G12D inhibitor (Phase 1, ORR=61%)
- **HORIZON-Lung**: HER2 ADC in NSCLC (Phase 2, ORR=74.5%)
- **SKYSCRAPER-01**: Tiragolumab + Atezolizumab (Phase 3, N=534)

The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the latest clinical trial results, helping researchers and clinicians quickly identify promising therapies across different cancer types and treatment modalities.
