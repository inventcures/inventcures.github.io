Abstract
Background:
Novel immune strategies are needed to improve outcomes in patients (pts) with microsatellitestable metastatic colorectal cancer (MSS mCRC). Our personalized peptide vaccine platform termed NeoAg-VAX - targets up to 10 tumor-derived neoantigens per pt. We hypothesize that
this vaccine combined with anti-PD-1 can enhance antitumor immunity and revert the cold status
of the MSS CRC tumor microenvironment (TME).

Methods:
This is a single-center, non-randomized, open-label, investigator-led pilot study of NeoAg-VAX
+/- pembrolizumab (pembro) in MSS mCRC pts. Tumor antigens were selected based on
predicted HLA-binding affinity using whole-exome/RNA sequencing and tandem mass
spectrometry with bioinformatics tools. Key eligibility criteria: biopsiable disease, > 1 line of
standard therapy, ECOG 0-1. Cohort A: NeoAg-VAX alone. Cohort B: NeoAg-VAX + pembro 200
mg IV Q3W. Vaccines were given subcutaneously with topical imiquimod adjuvant on weeks 0, 1,
3-6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 27, 30, 39, and 51. Primary endpoints: feasibility, toxicity. Secondary
endpoints: ORR, PFS, 12-week PFS rate, T cell response by IFNγ ELISPOT. Spatial proteomic
analysis of TME immune features was performed using imaging mass cytometry (IMC) of pretreatment tumors.

Results:

note, 8 pts from Cohort A were sequentially retreated in Cohort B. In 24 of 28 pts, NeoAg-VAX
was manufactured within 12 weeks of enrollment with at least 1 dose given, indicating a
feasibility rate of 85.7%. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were grade 1-2 in severity,

IFNγ ELISPOT of peripheral blood showed robust induction of neoantigen-specific T cell
responses with a median 5.9-fold increase (range: 1.3-18.1) compared to baseline. IMC of pretreatment tumors (n=9) revealed heterogeneity in immune cell composition across different
metastatic sites (6 lung, 2 liver, 1 ovary). Neighborhood analysis revealed shorter distances
between T cells and tumor cells as well as longer distances between myeloid cells and tumor
cells in lung vs liver mets. Lastly, there was a positive correlation between the magnitude of
vaccine-induced T cell response and density of intratumor T cells (r=0.72, p=0.043), B cells
(r=0.88, p=0.0043) and macrophages (r=0.72, p=0.044) at baseline.

Conclusions:
Personalized immunotherapy with NeoAg-VAX +/- anti-PD-1 was feasible, safe, and
immunogenic in MSS mCRC pts. Although clinical responses were modest, spatial proteomics
revealed key features of tumor immune contexture that may inform future therapeutic
approaches.
