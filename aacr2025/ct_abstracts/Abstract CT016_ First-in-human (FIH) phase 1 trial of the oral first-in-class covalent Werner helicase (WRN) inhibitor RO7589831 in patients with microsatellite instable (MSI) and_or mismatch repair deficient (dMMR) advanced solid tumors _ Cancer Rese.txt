Abstract
Background:
WRN is an enzyme critical for DNA repair and genome stability and is a promising synthetic
lethal target for MSI cancers. 40-70 % of patients (pts) with MSI/dMMR solid tumors do not
respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) or develop resistance, representing an unmet
need in MSI cancers. RO7589831 is a novel first-in-class covalent, irreversible WRN inhibitor
that induces dose-dependent DNA damage and tumor growth inhibition in MSI preclinical
models, supporting its clinical evaluation in MSI pts.

Methods:
This open-label, multi-center, FIH study assesses the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK),
pharmacodynamics (PD) and preliminary anti-tumor activity of RO7589831 in pts with MSI and/or
dMMR advanced solid tumors (NCT06004245). The primary objective is to determine the
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). 14 paired tumor
biopsies were collected for translational analysis.

As of Nov 25, 2024, 44 pts (24 F, 20 M; median age 62y (32-77y)) were enrolled in six dose
cohorts at RO7589831 daily doses from 150 mg to 2000 mg. Based on clinical first dose PK data

(rapid absorption, mean Tmax 2.6 h [± 1.3h] and half-life 4.4 h [±1.8h], n=41), RO7589831 was
dosed orally once (QD) or twice (BID) daily. Among the 44 pts (22 colorectal (CRC) and 22 nonCRC), median prior treatment lines were 3 (range 1-12); 89% had received ICIs. 35 pts had MSI
tumors (18 CRC and 17 non-CRC). No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) have been reported and the
MTD has not been reached. The most common treatment-emergent AEs across all doses were
nausea (52.3%), diarrhea (34.1%), and vomiting (31.8%). Grade (G)3 treatment related AEs
(TRAE) were nausea and increased AST/ALT in 2 pts each (4.3%) as well as fatigue and anemia
in 1 pt each (2.1%). No G4 or worse TRAEs were observed. Of the efficacy evaluable MSI pts
(n= 32), four RECISTv1.1 partial responses (PRs) (2 confirmed and 2 ongoing unconfirmed PRs)
were observed in post-ICI-treated MSI CRC (n=1), ovarian (n=1), and endometrial cancer (n=2)
for up to 9.5+ mths. Disease control rate (DCR) was 68.8% (95%CI 51.13, 86.37) and 20
(62.5%) pts achieved RECISTv1.1 stable disease (SD). 48.4% (15/31) of FDG-PET scan
evaluable pts across all dose levels showed metabolic responses to RO7589831. All pts with
RECIST PR showed pronounced metabolic responses (-50% to -90%). ctDNA molecular
responses were observed in 2/2 pts with RECISTv1.1 PR, 8/9 pts with SD and 0/5 pts with
disease progression.

Conclusions:
RO7589831 is generally safe and well tolerated, with promising DCR, durable RECISTv1.1,
FDG-PET metabolic and ctDNA molecular responses in pts with advanced MSI cancers,
including ICI-treated pts, providing the first early clinical proof-of-concept for effectively drugging
WRN. Dose optimization cohorts are ongoing to establish the RP2D.
