Abstract
Background:
Clinical benefit of first generation BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) as monotherapy is limited due to
paradoxical feedback activation of downstream MAPK or EGFR; combinations with MEK
inhibitors (in melanoma) or EGFR antibodies (in colorectal cancer [CRC]) have become a
standard of care in BRAF V600-mutant tumors. RG6344 (RO7276389) is a novel brain penetrant
paradox breaker BRAFi designed to address the limitations of approved BRAFi.

Methods:
Dose escalation of RG6344, as a single agent and in combination with standard dose of
cobimetinib, is being conducted in participants with solid tumors harboring a BRAF V600E
mutation up to the protocol specified maximum daily dose. The objectives were to define the
maximum tolerated dose (MTD), the recommended Phase 2 dose and additionally to
characterize safety, PK/PD, and clinical outcomes (ISRCTN13713551).

Results:
As of December 5, 2024, 66 patients (56% with prior BRAFi treatment), including 7 patients with

brain lesions, have been treated with RG6344 in the monotherapy dose
escalation part of the study and 12 patients in the combination part with cobimetinib including 5
patients with measurable and one with non-measurable brain lesions. Eleven melanoma, 51

CRC, 4 patients with other cancers received at least one dose of study drug as a single agent
(dose escalation in combination still ongoing and not reported). One dose limiting toxicity event
of grade 3 rash maculo-papular was reported. MTD has not been reached up to the highest daily
dose of 3600 mg. Grade 3 treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) occurred in 11 patients (16.6 %),
grade 4 TRAEs in 2 patients (3%; both laboratory findings) and no grade 5 TRAEs were
reported. 2 patients (3%) discontinued study treatment due to TRAEs. None of the known BRAFi
class toxicities, such as cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas, including Palmar-Plantar
Erythrodysesthesia (PPE) and keratoacanthoma, have been observed to date. Linear and timeindependent PK was demonstrated across the tested dose range, reaching Ctrough levels
exceeding PK-derived pERK inhibition >90%. Exposure -response (metabolic responses
measured with FDG-PET) relationship was observed. Objective response rate (ORR) was 25%
in a total of 64 evaluable patients across tumor types and doses including patients with brain
metastases and/or refractory to or relapsing on prior BRAFi treatment.

Conclusions:
RG6344 is well tolerated allowing unprecedented exposure for pERK inhibition and shows
promising preliminary activity.
