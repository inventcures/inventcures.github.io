Abstract
Background:
Development of acneiform rash in patients with colon cancer treated with anti-EGFR therapies
frequently results in dose attenuation or discontinuation, thereby limiting benefits. BRAF
inhibitors block the MAPK pathway in BRAF V600 mutant cells, while they paradoxically activate
the MAPK pathway in BRAF wild type cells. We hypothesized that a topical formulation of a
BRAF inhibitor (LUT014 gel) applied to the areas of acneiform rash would reverse the upstream
inhibition of EGFR in skin, thereby reactivating the MAPK pathway and improving the rash and
cancer treatment.

Methods:
Patients with colorectal cancer with grade 2 or non-infected grade 3 acneiform rash while
receiving cetuximab or panitumumab were randomized 1:1:1 to: LUT014 gel 0.03%, LUT014 gel
0.1%, or placebo gel. Patients applied the gel to all areas of rash daily for 28 days. Primary
endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved treatment “success” defined as
improvement of at least one grade CTCAE score or an improvement of at least 5 for the skinspecific FACT-EGFRI-18 HRQoL. Patients were analyzed via intention to treat (ITT) or as
“evaluable pts (EP)” (i.e., those who applied the drug at least once and did not drop out due to

rash such as disease progression). Sample size calculation was based on an
expected treatment success of 20% for the placebo group and 50% for one of the treatment

groups. A total of 117 patients were required for a two group
significance and 80% power.

Results:
The trial enrolled 117 patients from 23 sites. Efficacy is shown in the table. In the ITT as well as
the EP, the composite endpoint demonstrated statistically significant rates of success for both
LUT014 groups compared to placebo. The table also shows grade 1-5 adverse events (AE)
related or suspected to be related to treatment.

Conclusion:
This is the first placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial demonstrating the benefit and safety
of an agent for treatment of the acneiform rash associated with anti-EGFR.
