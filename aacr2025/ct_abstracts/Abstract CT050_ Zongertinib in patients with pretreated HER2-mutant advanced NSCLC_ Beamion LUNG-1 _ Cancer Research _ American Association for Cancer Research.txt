Abstract
Background:
Zongertinib is an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor that selectively inhibits HER2 while sparing
EGFR, thereby limiting associated toxicities. Zongertinib was granted Fast Track and
Breakthrough Therapy Designations by the FDA for patients (pts) with advanced, unresectable,
or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have activating HER2 mutations
and who have received prior systemic therapy. Beamion LUNG-1 (NCT04886804) is a Phase
(Ph) Ia/Ib study evaluating zongertinib in pts with HER2-mutant advanced/metastatic NSCLC in
Ph Ib. At the primary analysis (May 2024) of Ph Ib Cohort 1, the primary endpoint, confirmed
response by blinded independent central review (BICR), was met in pts with pretreated HER2mutant NSCLC within the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD). Here, we report the previously
unreported median duration of response (DoR) and median progression-free survival (PFS) for
Cohort 1, and first data from Cohorts 3 and 5.

Methods:
In Cohort 1, pts with pretreated HER2-mutant NSCLC within the TKD were initially randomized to
receive zongertinib 120 mg or 240 mg once-daily; the 120 mg dose was selected at an interim
analysis. In exploratory Cohort 3, pts had pretreated HER2-mutant NSCLC with TKD or non-TKD
mutations. In Cohort 5, pts had HER2-mutant NSCLC within the TKD and were pretreated with a
HER2-directed antibody-drug conjugate. In Cohorts 3 and 5, pts initially received zongertinib 240
mg. to

response; RECIST v1.1) by BICR (Cohorts 1 and 5) and investigator review (Cohort 3).
Secondary endpoints included DoR and PFS.

Results:
As of November 29, 2024, 75 pts in Cohort 1, 20 pts with non-TKD mutations in Cohort 3, and 31
pts in Cohort 5 had received zongertinib 120 mg; treatment was ongoing in 33 (44%), 4 (20%),
and 13 (42%) pts, respectively. In Cohort 1, the objective response rate (ORR) by BICR was
71% (95% CI: 60-80) and disease control rate (DCR) was 96% (95% CI: 89-99). In Cohort 3, the
ORR was 30% (95% CI: 15-52) and DCR was 65% (95% CI: 43-82). In Cohort 5, the ORR was
48% (95% CI: 32-65) and DCR was 97% (95% CI: 84-99). Median (95% CI) DoR and PFS were
14.1 (6.9-not evaluable [NE]) months and 12.4 (8.2-NE) months in Cohort 1 and 5.3 (2.8-NE)
months and 6.8 (5.4-NE) months in Cohort 5. DoR and PFS in Cohort 3 were not yet mature.
Drug-related adverse events (all/grade [G] ≥3) were reported in 97%/17%, 80%/25%, and
77%/3% of pts in Cohorts 1, 3, and 5, respectively, most commonly diarrhea in all cohorts
(mainly G1). There were no cases of drug-related interstitial lung disease (ILD).

Conclusions:
Zongertinib demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful activity with a manageable safety
profile in pts with pretreated advanced NSCLC harboring HER2 mutations.
