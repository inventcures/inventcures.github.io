Abstract
Background:
Tiragolumab (tira) + atezolizumab (atezo) has shown encouraging survival outcomes in pts with
metastatic NSCLC, primarily in pts with PD-L1-high tumors (tumor proportion score [TPS] ≥50%).
SKYSCRAPER-01 (NCT04294810) is a phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized
trial investigating the efficacy and safety of first-line tira + atezo in pts with PD-L1-high NSCLC.

Methods:
Eligible pts (previously untreated; PD-L1-high, locally advanced unresectable/metastatic NSCLC;
EGFR/ALK wildtype) were randomized 1:1 to receive tira 600 mg IV + atezo 1200 mg IV or pbo +
atezo 1200 mg IV every 3 weeks until disease progression, loss of clinical benefit, or
unacceptable toxicity. Primary endpoints: investigator-assessed progression-free survival (INVPFS) and overall survival (OS) in the primary analysis set (PAS; TPS ≥50%; 22C3 assay).
Secondary endpoints: INV-objective response rate (INV-ORR) and INV-duration of response
(INV-DOR) in the PAS; OS in the secondary analysis set (SAS; tumor cell [TC] ≥50%; SP263
assay).

Results:
A total of 534 pts were randomized (tira + atezo, n=266; pbo + atezo, n=268). Pt characteristics

between treatment arms. At the final PFS analysis (data cut-off 12 Mar 2022;
median follow-up 9.9 months), median INV-PFS was 7.0 months with tira + atezo and 5.6 months
with pbo + atezo (HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.63, 0.97; p=0.02; PAS). At the final OS analysis (data cuthttps://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/85/8_Supplement_2/CT051/761657/Abstract-CT051-SKYSCRAPER-01-A-phase-III

and 16.9 months with pbo + atezo (HR 0.87; 95% CI 0.71, 1.08; p=0.22; PAS; Table). Tira +
atezo demonstrated an acceptable safety profile, consistent with previous observations.

Abstract CT051: SKYSCRAPER-01: A phase III, randomized trial of tiragolumab (tira) + atezolizumab (atezo) versus placebo (pbo) + atezo …

Conclusion:
The primary endpoints of INV-PFS and OS were not met in the SKYSCRAPER-01 study.
Numerical improvements in both PFS and OS with tira + atezo versus pbo + atezo suggest
potential antitumor activity of TIGIT targeting in NSCLC.
