Abstract
Background:
JYP0322 is a potent, brain-penetrant and highly selective ROS1 inhibitor, demonstrating over
100-fold selectivity for ROS1 compared to TRKA and sub-nanomolar potency against the ROS1
G2032R resistance mutation. JYP0322 is designed to simultaneously address the key clinical
challenges including ROS1 resistance mutations, tumor brain metastases while avoiding the offtarget neurotoxicity associated with TRK inhibition.

Method:
The Phase I study (NCT06128148) was designed to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and
preliminary clinical efficacy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic ROS1+NSCLC,
including both ROS1 TKI pre-treated patients as well as TKI naïve patients. Response was
assessed by investigators according to RECIST V1.1.

Results:
As of December 10, 2024, dose escalation study was conducted across 7 dose levels: 50mg qd,
100mg qd, 200mg qd, 100mg bid, 150mg bid, 200mg bid, 150mg tid and dose expansion stage
is ongoing at doses of 100mg bid, 150mg bid and 150mg tid. A total of 73 NSCLC patients were
enrolled. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The most frequently reported treatment

hyperglyceridemia (31.5%), hypercholesteremia (26%), and AST elevation (21.9%). Grade 3-5
TRAE occurred in 12.3% patients. Only low grade neurotoxicities (6.8%) occurred. Among 58

efficacy evaluable patients, objective response rates (ORRs) were 85.7% (12/14) for ROS1 TKI
naive, 54.5% (12/22) for patients previously received ≥2L systemic therapy and ≥1 prior ROS1
TKIs including 19 patients pre-treated with 2 to 4 ROS1 TKIs (Table). In ROS1 G2032R mutant
cancers, ORR was 71.4% (5/7) with 3 patients pre-treated with Lorlatinib. In patients with
measurable brain metastasis at baseline, intracranial ORR was 33.3% (2/6) and intracranial DCR
was 83.3%. JYP0322 showed significantly brain penetration ability with the brain to plasma ration
1.20. Enrollment in the dose expansion stage is ongoing.

Conclusions:
JYP0322 had a favorable safety profile with a low incidence of neurotoxicities. It showed highly
promising anti-tumor effects in patients with ROS1+NSCLC including both TKI-naïve and TKI
pre-treated patients, as well as those with TKI-heavily treated, brain metastases, or harboring
ROS1 G2032R mutation.
