Abstract
Background:
Lung cancer is the primary cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality globally.
Approximately 30% of patients with EGFR mutation (EGFRm) in NSCLC are diagnosed at an
early stage and are candidates for curative-intent surgical resection; however, disease
recurrence remains a substantial clinical challenge. Aumolertinib is a third-generation EGFR TKI
that potently inhibits both sensitizing EGFR mutations (ex19del/L858R) and the resistance
mutation T790M. ARTS (NCT04687241) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
multicenter, phase 3 trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant aumolertinib
versus placebo in patients with stage II-IIIB EGFRm NSCLC after complete resection, with or
without adjuvant chemotherapy.

Methods:
Inclusion criteria included patients aged ≥18 years, ECOG PS 0-1, primary non-squamous stage
II/IIIA/IIIB (T3N2M0) NSCLC, confirmed EGFRm (ex19del or L858R), complete resection with full
postsurgical recovery, with or without postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients were
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive aumolertinib (110 mg orally, once daily) or matched placebo

for a planned treatment duration of 3 years. Stratification was based on stage (II, IIIA N2-, IIIA/B
N2+) and mutation type (ex19del, L858R). The primary endpoint was disease-free survival
(DFS), assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). Secondary endpoints included

investigator-assessed DFS, overall survival (OS), and safety profile. Data cutoff (DCO): April 15,
2024.

Results:
A total of 214 patients from China were randomized to treatment (Aumolertinib n=107, Placebo
n=107). Baseline characteristics were balanced across treatment arms (aumolertinib/placebo):
female 55.1%/57.0%, ever-smokers 28.0%/29.9%, stage II 44.9%/44.9%, stage III 54.2%/52.3%,
ex19del 47.7%/50.5%, L858R 52.3%/49.5%, ECOG PS 0 36.4%/41.1%, ECOG PS 1
63.6%/58.9%. Median follow-up for DFS was 27.6 months. The mDFS assessed by BICR was
not reached (95% CI, 29.1 to NA) in the aumolertinib arm versus 19.4 months (95% CI, 11.2 to
26.2) in the placebo arm; hazard ratio (HR) 0.166 (95% CI, 0.094 to 0.294); p<0.0001. The 2year DFS rate was 88.2% in the aumolertinib arm versus 40.6% in the placebo arm. Investigatorassessed DFS was concordant with BICR assessment. OS data were immature at DCO
(aumolertinib/placebo OS maturity: 2.8%/3.8%). The incidence of AEs leading to dose
interruptions, dose reductions, and discontinuation in the aumolertinib/ placebo arm was 12.3%/
17.8%, 9.4%/ 1.9%, and 0.9%/ 0, respectively. No new safety risks were observed.

Conclusions:
Adjuvant aumolertinib demonstrates a statistically significant and clinically meaningful
improvement in DFS in patients with stage II-IIIB EGFRm NSCLC following complete tumor
resection and adjuvant chemotherapy, when indicated. This DFS benefit underscores the
promise of aumolertinib in fulfilling an unmet need for effective adjuvant EGFR-targeted therapy
in early-stage NSCLC.
