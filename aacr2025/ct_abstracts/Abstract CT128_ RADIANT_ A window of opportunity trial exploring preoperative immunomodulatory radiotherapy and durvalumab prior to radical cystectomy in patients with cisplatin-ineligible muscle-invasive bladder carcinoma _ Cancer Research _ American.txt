Abstract
Background:
Ionizing radiotherapy (RT) can potentially enhance anti-tumour responses to immune checkpoint
inhibitors. In doses of 6-9Gy/fraction, RT releases free cytosolic DNA which upregulates cyclic
GMP-AMP synthase pathways (cGAS-STING) and increases tumor infiltrating CD8+ Tlymphocytes, inflammatory cytokines, programmed-death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, and
antigen presentation. However >12Gy/fraction RT may paradoxically upregulate TREX1,
degrade cytosolic DNA and lead to immunosuppression. We conducted a WOO trial to explore
an immunomodulating dose of RT with anti-PD-L1 in patients with MIBC.

Methods:
Eligible patients had histologically confirmed urothelial carcinoma AJCC stage T2-T4aN0,
planned for radical cystectomy, ECOG PS 0-2, and ineligible or refused neoadjuvant cisplatinbased chemotherapy. Patients received a single 8-Gy fraction of RT to bladder followed 4 days
later by durvalumab 1500mg IV q3week x3. Cystectomy was performed 7-35 days after last
durvalumab. Primary endpoint was pathological complete response (pCR: ypT0N0). Secondary
endpoints were safety, pathological response (pCR: ypTisN0), recurrence-free survival, overall

survival, and tumor/blood correlatives. Transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) and
cystectomy samples were profiled using the Oncomine Comprehensive Assay Plus (DNA), Ion
AmpliSeq (RNA), and GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling (protein).

Results:
14 patients were enrolled with clinical stage T2 (n=9), T3 (n=3), and T4 (n=2). 5 (36%) had
multifocal disease, 7 (50%) had associated carcinoma in situ, 4 (29%) had prior intravesicular
therapy, and 11 (79%) had optimal TURBT prior to cystectomy. All patients received 8Gy RT and
3 cycles of durvalumab. Durvalumab-related grade 1-2 adverse events (AE) were hypothyroidism
(2), fatigue (1), shoulder pain (1), alkaline phosphatase increase (1), AST elevation (1), and
pruritis (1). RT related grade 1-2 AEs were fatigue (2), dysuria (2), and rash (1). There were no
related grade 3+ adverse events or surgical delays due to RT or durvalumab. PCR was obtained
in 7/14 (50%); PR was demonstrated in 8/14 (57%) and more likely to occur in patients with
multifocal disease and optimal TURBT. Luminal TCGA subtype, DNA damage repair gene
alterations and high tumor mutational burden (≥10 mut/Mb) were enriched in PR (75%, 50% and
50% respectively) compared with non-PR (33%, 17%, and 33%). The 12 and 18-month landmark
survival for PR vs non-PR was 83.3 vs 62.5% and 83.3 vs 31.5% respectively.

Conclusions:
Immune modulating doses of RT and durvalumab were associated with a high pCR and PR rates
with excellent tolerability. Further exploration of hypofractionated bladder RT schemes with antiPD-L1 are warranted.
