Abstract
Background:
Dual immune checkpoint inhibition with botensilimab (bot, Fc-enhanced anti-CTLA4) plus
balstilimab (bal, anti-PD1) has shown promising efficacy across a variety of classically nonimmunogenic tumors, such as mismatch-repair proficient (pMMR) colorectal cancers (CRC) and
sarcomas. In the adaptive, pan-cancer, phase II NEOASIS study, we hypothesize a high rate of
pathological responses to neoadjuvant bot/bal in both pMMR and MMR deficient (dMMR)
tumors. Here we present the safety and efficacy data from the safety run-in cohorts of the
NEOASIS study.

Methods:
Patients (pts) with non-metastatic solid tumors were assigned to the dMMR or pMMR safety runin cohorts based on IHC assessment of MMR proteins and were planned for surgery within 8
weeks of start of study treatment. Each cohort consisted of 10 pts. Patients were treated with bal
450mg on D1 and D22 plus bot on D1, at a dose of 25mg for the first 5 pts and 50mg for the next
5 pts. The primary objective of the safety run-ins was safety. Secondary objectives included
pathological response (≤50% residual viable tumor, RVT), major pathological response (MPR,
≤10% RVT) and pathological complete response (pCR).

A total of 20 pts were treated: 10 with a dMMR and 10 with a pMMR tumor. The dMMR cohort
included 9 pts with CRC and 1 with duodenal cancer (25mg bot cohort). The pMMR cohort

consisted of pts with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC, n=6), ER+ BC (n=2), Merkel cell
carcinoma (MCC, n=1) and sarcoma (n=1). No dose-limiting toxicities occurred at either 25mg or
50mg bot doses and all pts underwent timely surgery. One grade 3 immune-related adverse
event (irAE, hepatitis) was observed in the 50mg cohort. Grade 1-2 irAEs occurred in 75% of pts,
with fatigue (25%), dermatitis (20%) and hypothyroidism (15%) being the most frequent. IrAEs
led to omission of the second dose of bal in 2 (10%) pts. All 5 pts in the pMMR 25mg bot cohort
had a pathological response including 2 pts with a pCR (MCC, TNBC) and 3 pts with an MPR
(sarcoma, ER+ BC, TNBC). In the pMMR bot 50 mg cohort, 2 pts had a pathological response,
both an MPR (2 TNBC). In the dMMR 25mg bot cohort, 4 pts with CRC had a pathological
response, including 2 pCR, 1 MPR and 1 PR. The only pt with limited response (duodenal
cancer) had suspicion of peritoneal metastases per-operatively and while biopsies revealed no
RVT in these lesions, the primary tumor showed limited response. All 5 CRC pts treated with bot
50mg had a pCR.

Conclusion:
Data of the safety run-in of 20 pts show that neoadjuvant bot/bal was safe and did not lead to
surgical delays. In addition, the observed pathological responses are encouraging and suggest a
potential for neoadjuvant immunotherapy using bot/bal across tumor types, including pMMR BC
and sarcoma. Accrual in efficacy baskets for both dMMR and pMMR tumors is currently ongoing
at the bot 50mg dose level.
