Abstract
Background:
Tumor-informed circulating tumor (ct) DNA testing is recognized as a powerful predictor of CRC
recurrence. However, the benefit of systemic therapy to prevent or delay clinical recurrence in
patients (pts) with molecular recurrence after curative surgery remains uncertain.

Methods:
Pts with CRC who had undergone curative resection of primary and/or metastatic sites +
standard of care (SoC) adjuvant treatment, if applicable, were enrolled in ALTAIR study if they (1)
prospectively tested positive for ctDNA using a clinically validated, personalized assay
(Signatera™, Natera, Inc.) within 3 months before enrollment and (2) had no recurrence on
radiological (CT) imaging. Pts were randomized to receive FTD/TPI or placebo for 6 months. CT
scans and ctDNA analyses were conducted every 2 months in the first year, every 3 months in
the second year, and every 6 months in the third year. The primary endpoint was disease-free
survival (DFS), with secondary endpoints including ctDNA clearance, overall survival (OS), and
adverse events. The study assumed a median DFS of 8 months in the placebo group, an HR of
0.667 for the FTD/TPI group, 0.05 significance level, 0.80 power, 2-year enrollment, and 1-year
follow-up,

Between July 2020 and June 2023, 243 pts were enrolled and randomized to FTD/TPI (n=122)
or placebo (n=121). Baseline characteristics were balanced, and 96.3% of pts received SoC
treatment postoperatively. FTD/TPI group had a median DFS of 9.30 months vs. 5.55 months in
the placebo group, which did not reach statistical significance in the primary population (HR,
0.79; 95% CI, 0.60-1.05; P = 0.107). The benefit was highly pronounced, however, in stage IV
pts (HR: 0.53, P = 0.012). In addition, after excluding pts with low ctDNA levels (<0.179 MTM/mL,
threshold determined by ROC analysis) from both arms, significant benefit with FTD/TPI was
observed in the primary population, resulting in an improved DFS (N=154, HR: 0.61 95% CI:
0.43-0.85; P = 0.003) with a median DFS of 8.12 months for FTD/TPI vs. 3.89 months for
placebo; consistent with these findings, a trend toward higher ctDNA clearance rate was
observed for the FTD/TPI group (8.33%), compared to placebo (4.05%).OS data remain
immature, with 24 events reported across both arms. Grade ≥3 adverse events occurred in
73.0% of the FTD/TPI arm versus 3.3% in the placebo arm, with no new safety signals.

Conclusions:
Although statistical significance was not reached in the primary population, FTD/TPI showed
benefit in pts with high molecular tumor burden and/ or Stage IV disease, resulting in improved
DFS.
