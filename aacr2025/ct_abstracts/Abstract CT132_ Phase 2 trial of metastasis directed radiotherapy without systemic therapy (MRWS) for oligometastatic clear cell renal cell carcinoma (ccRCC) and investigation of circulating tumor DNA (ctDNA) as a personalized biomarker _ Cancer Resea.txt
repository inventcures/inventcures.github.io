Abstract
Background:
Current treatment for frontline ccRCC focuses on systemic therapy doublets. Although effective,
such combinations exhibit substantial toxicities and healthcare costs. An underutilized option is
MRWS, which may facilitate a prolonged systemic therapy-free interval in select patients.
Unfortunately, no reliable prognostic markers exist to select patients for MRWS. Although ctDNA
assays may guide patient selection, implementation in ccRCC has proven challenging due to
limited ctDNA shedding. Therefore, advanced sequencing and bioinformatic pipelines are
needed to enhance ctDNA reliability in ccRCC.

Methods:
This phase 2 single-arm trial (NCT03575611) enrolled patients with oligometastatic ccRCC and
up to 5 metastases. All patients had either never received systemic therapy or ceased >1 month
earlier. Patients were treated with MRWS, consisting of predominately stereotactic radiation
therapy to all sites of disease. Subsequent rounds of MRWS were administered if limited
progression was observed. The co-primary endpoints were progression free survival (PFS) and
systemic therapy free survival (STFS). For the latter, a median STFS of >24 months (mo) was
prespecified as the threshold for success. Individualized ctDNA panels (Myriad Genetics) were
created from tumor whole genome sequencing and applied to serial plasma samples. Molecular
residual disease (MRD) status was determined based on whether ctDNA was detected (MRD+)

or not (MRD-).

Between July 2018 to May 2023, 121 oligometastatic ccRCC patients were enrolled. Median
follow up was 36 mo (range 13-68 mo). Most patients (72%) had 1 site of metastatic disease and
had never received systemic therapy (70%). The median PFS was 18 mo (95% CI: 15-22 mo)
and STFS was 34 mo (95% CI: 28-54 mo). The lower bounds of 95% CI of the median STFS
exceeded the prespecified 24 mo threshold for success. Two-year PFS and STFS were 40% and
75%, respectively. Median OS was not reached, and 2- and 3-year OS were 94% and 87%,
respectively. Eight (7%) patients experienced grade 3+ toxicities at least possibly attributed to
MRWS. There were no grade 5 toxicities.MRD+ was detected in 56% of patients at baseline and
associated with significantly shorter STFS (HR 2.9, 95% CI 1.4-6.1, P=0.003). Patients who were
MRD+ and MRD- at baseline exhibited 27 vs. 54 mo median STFS, respectively. Three months
after MRWS, 31% of MRD + patients converted to MRD-. Positive MRD status at 3 month follow
up was strongly associated with shorter STFS (HR 4.3, 95% CI 2.0-9.0, P<0.001).

Conclusions:
MRWS exhibited excellent tolerability and facilitated prolonged time off systemic therapy without
compromising OS. Our ctDNA approach appears to be a promising baseline prognostic
biomarker for STFS and a dynamic marker of MRWS response.
