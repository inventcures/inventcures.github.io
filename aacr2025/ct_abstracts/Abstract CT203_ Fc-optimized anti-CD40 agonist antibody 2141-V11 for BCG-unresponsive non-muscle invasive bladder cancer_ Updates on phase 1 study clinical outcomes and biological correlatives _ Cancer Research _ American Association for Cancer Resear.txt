Abstract
Introduction and Objectives:
2141-V11 is a novel anti-CD40 antibody developed by our group, with enhanced binding to
FcγRIIB that results in effective tumor-specific T-cell responses in vivo and in a recent first-inhuman phase I clinical trial (NCT04059588). In several preclinical bladder cancer models,
including BCG-unresponsive disease, intravesical administration of 2141-V11 results in durable
anti-tumor immunity without systemic toxicity. Based on these findings, we initiated a first in
human Phase I/II study of intravesical 2141-V11 for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC.

Methods:
This is an investigator-initiated Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety
and tolerability of intravesical 2141-V11 in patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC who are
ineligible for or decline radical cystectomy (NCT05126472) (N=25). Following complete
transurethral resection, intravesical 2141-V11 is administered once weekly for three doses with
re-treatment eligibility at week 13 and 25, depending on disease status. Dose escalation follows
an MCRM design (5 dose levels from 0.7 to 70 mg). The primary endpoints are safety and dose
tolerability to determine maximal tolerated dose (MTD) and/or RP2D. Secondary endpoints
include pharmacokinetic profiling and preliminary evaluation of clinical activity. Exploratory

Results:
Full enrollment (n= 25) was achieved by the data cutoff of December 28th, 2024. Patients
included had carcinoma in situ (CIS) with or without TA/T1 (N=18) or TA/T1 without CIS (N=7).
Intravesical 2141-V11 was well tolerated (no grade ≥3 events) with no dose-limiting toxicities up
to the highest tested dose of 70mg of drug. MTD was not reached. Complete response (CR) was
achieved in 10 (41.7%) out of 25 patients. Among 19 evaluable patients at six months, 7 (37%)
achieved CR at 6 months, with final therapeutic analysis pending completion of follow up. At
baseline, no significant differences were observed in the absolute counts of major immune cell
populations (CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cell, B cells, dendritic cells[DC], Tregs) between responders
and non-responders. Post-treatment, responders exhibited increased interactions between DCs
and specific CD8+ T cell subsets, including activated, cytotoxic, and CXCL13+ CD8+ T cells. In
contrast, these interactions significantly decreased in non-responders. Tertiary lymphoid
structures (TLS) were present in both responders and non-responders at baseline. However,
responders showed an increase in TLS upon treatment with 2141-V11, while TLS numbers
decreased in non-responders.

Conclusions:
In patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, intravesical administration of 2141-V11 is safe and
leads to CR in a subset of patients. 2141-V11 promotes immune interactions among dendritic
cells and distinct subsets of CD8+ T cells and is associated with increased presence of TLS in
clinical responders. These findings provide biological rationale for further evaluation of this agent
in the treatment of NMIBC.
