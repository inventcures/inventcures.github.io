Abstract
Background:
Runimotamab is a HER2 x CD3 T cell-engaging bispecific antibody developed for patients with
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-expressing cancers that promotes cytotoxic T
cell lysis of HER2-expressing cells. We hypothesized that co-treatment with trastuzumab may
reduce on-target/off-tumor toxicities of runimotamab and increase its therapeutic index due to
decreased runimotamab binding to low-expressing HER2 normal tissues. This first-in-human,
dose-escalation study assessed the preliminary safety and anti-tumor activity of runimotamab
alone and with trastuzumab in patients with HER2-expressing BC.

Methods:
Patients with locally advanced or metastatic BC received escalating doses of runimotamab IV
either alone (Ph 1a) or in combination with trastuzumab (Ph 1b) to determine maximum tolerated
doses. In Cycle (C) 1, runimotamab was administered using step dose fractionation, with a stepup dose given on Day (D) 1, followed by the initial target dose on D8. Subsequent runimotamab
target doses were given on D1 of each 3-week cycle (Q3W). In Ph 1b, trastuzumab was

administered
prior to runimotamab, first on C1D-1, and then Q3W on D1 of each cycle. Study
objectives included evaluation of safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK),
pharmacodynamics, and anti-tumor activity. Data cut-off date was 01Aug2024.

Results:
Overall, 73 BC patients were enrolled: 20 in Ph 1a and 53 in Ph 1b (NCT03448042). Median
number of all prior therapies was 7 in Ph 1a and 8 in Ph 1b patients. The highest runimotamab
doses administered in Ph 1b (100/300 mg on C1D1/D8) surpassed those in Ph 1a (1.7/5 mg). At
or above pharmacologically active doses of runimotamab (≥ 0.72/2.2 mg), cytokine release
syndrome (CRS) rate was lower in Ph 1b (31%, n=15/48, Grade 1-2) compared to Ph 1a (78%,
n=7/9, Grade 1-2) patients. The most common treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs; ≥20%
patients) among all safety-evaluable patients were CRS, hypophosphatemia, pyrexia, ALT/AST
increased, headache, nausea, rash, pruritus, and fatigue. Grade ≥3 TRAEs occurred in 4 (20%)
Ph 1a and 20 (37.7%) Ph 1b patients. Runimotamab PK was dose-proportional in Ph 1a/b
patients. Co-administration with trastuzumab dampened runimotamab-induced T cell activation
and cytokine induction. Anti-tumor activity was observed in Ph 1b only, at runimotamab doses
≥2.2/6.6 mg. Runimotamab 20/60 mg combined with trastuzumab was chosen for dose
expansion. Seven of 23 (30.4%) runimotamab 20/60 mg patients had confirmed responses,
including 1 CR and 6 PRs.

Conclusions:
Improved tolerability and higher runimotamab dose levels were achieved in combination with
trastuzumab, compared to runimotamab alone. Runimotamab + trastuzumab demonstrated a
manageable safety profile and encouraging clinical activity in heavily pretreated HER2-positive
BC patients.
