Abstract
Background:
Invikafusp alfa (STAR0602), a selective, dual T cell agonist targeting Vβ6/Vβ10 T cells, is being
evaluated in START-001: a multicenter Phase 1/2 monotherapy trial in patients with anti-PD(L)1resistant, antigen-rich solid tumors (TMB-H, MSI-H/dMMR, or virally associated).

Methods:
Reported here are: 1) updated clinical results of the completed dose escalation of intravenous
invikafusp, Q2W, per 3+3 design with backfill at optimal biological dose (OBD) levels; 2) first
report on RP2D determination based on PK, PD, safety and anti-tumor activity; 3) new results of
translational immunology studies.

Results:
As of 7 Jan 2025, 41 patients (18 with TMB-H tumors) with a median of 4 prior lines of therapies
across 18 different types of antigen-rich tumors were enrolled. Updated clinical results: No new
safety signals were seen since previously reported and the most common TEAE was CRS
(mostly grades 1 and 2), consistent with invikafusp’s MoA. Of 12 patients with TMB-H tumors
who received the OBD (either 0.08 or 0.12 mg/kg) monotherapy, 9 had ≥ 1 tumor assessment at

Overall, 6 (66.6%) of these 9 patients had disease control [confirmed
partial response (cPR) + stable disease (SD)]. Four (44.4%) of these 6 had measurable tumor
shrinkage per RECIST: 2 (22.2%) MSS CRC patients experienced cPR with one response lasting

∼12 months; 2 (22.2%) (1 with melanoma and 1 with pancreatic cancer) had tumor shrinkage
with overall SD. Another 2 (22.2%) of 6 (1 with esophageal cancer and the other with MSS CRC)
had SD. RP2D: Invikafusp peak serum concentrations (Cmax) increased proportionally with
doses ≥ 0.08 mg/kg resulting in Cmax at or above the pharmacological EC90. Dose-dependent,
selective expansion of peripheral Vβ6 and Vβ10 T cells was observed in all patients by flow
cytometry and gene expression analyses, with maximal peak expansion at 0.08 and 0.12 mg/kg
doses and decreasing expansion at 0.16 mg/kg. At the RP2D (0.08 mg/kg), CD8+ Vβ6/ Vβ10 T
cells reached an average peak expansion of ∼600% on Day 8. Translational studies (n=7
patients): Consistent with preclinical studies, expanded peripheral Vβ6/Vβ10 T cells exhibited an
atypical central memory (TCM) phenotype with expression of cytotoxic effector molecules.
Selected patients had ctDNA decrease and expansion of antigen-specific Vβ6/Vβ10 T cells with
one patient with ctDNA decrease who experienced stable disease and was on trial for ∼15
months. Increase in soluble markers of T cell activation (e.g., IFN-γ, sCD25) within hours after
dosing were observed, with less pro-inflammatory cytokine (e.g., TNF-α and IL-6) release up to
the RP2D.

Conclusions:
Invikafusp, a selective, dual T cell agonist, as monotherapy, led to clinically meaningful antitumor activity in anti-PD(L)-1 resistant tumors. It promoted potent and selective expansion of
mainly CD8+ Vβ6/ Vβ10 T cells with a novel TCM phenotype, and led to ctDNA decrease and
expansion of antigen-specific T cells. Based on these initial clinical results, US FDA granted Fast
track Designation for invikafusp in TMB-H CRC and a Phase 2 trial is ongoing in antigen-rich
(e.g., TMB-H & MSI-H/dMMR) tumors.
