Abstract
Background:
Mesothelioma is a lethal cancer caused by asbestos. Effective therapy in the relapsed setting,
following standard of care treatments is lacking [1]. Inhibition of Poly-ADP ribose polymerase
(PARPi) mediates synthetic lethality in cancers harboring DNA damage response gene (DDR)
inactivation, notably BRCA1/2 resulting in homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), and
transcription replication conflicts (TRCs). In relapsed mesothelioma PARPi was clinically active in
the MIST1 phase II trial [2], warranting interrogation of underlying mechanisms and further
randomized evaluation.

Methods:
NERO, NCT05455424 a multi-center, two-arm, open-label UK 2:1 randomized phase II trial
compared active symptom control (ASC) with or without Niraparib (Nir). Eligibility: Relapsed
mesothelioma with prior platinum doublet therapy (any line). The ASC+Nir arm received 200 or
300 mg daily in a 3-weekly cycle up to 24 weeks, with the option to continue if there was ongoing
disease control. Primary endpoint: progression-free survival (PFS), one-sided α=0.1 with 80%
power. In parallel, whole exome and transcriptomic analyses of the NERO, MIST1 cohort [2],
primary
patient
derived explants (PDEs) and cell lines were conducted to understand correlates

of PARPi sensitivity.

th

Between 11 July 2022 and 21st December 2023, 88 patients were enrolled. Characteristics:
male: n = 62 (70.5%), median age: 72 (range 33-84) years, disease site: 77 (87.5%) had pleural
mesothelioma. 83 (94.3%) PFS events were observed. Median (95% CI) PFS was 4.14 months
(m) (2.76, 4.73) in the ASC + Nir arm versus 2.76m (1.41, 3.02) corresponding to an unadjusted
PFS HR of 0.73 (one sided 90% CI 0.99, p-value 0.091). 6m PFS rate (95% CI) was 24.6%
(14.4%, 36.2%) for ASC+Nir versus 13.8% (4.4%, 28.6%) for ASC. Most common Adverse
Events (>20%) in the ASC+Nir arm: Fatigue (52.6%), Constipation (45.6%) & Nausea (43.9%).
Interferon (IFN) α transcription (9p21.3) but not HRD or DDR gene burden was correlated with
sensitivity to PARPi in MIST1, two PDE cohorts (Niraparib and Rucaparib), and in mesothelioma
cell lines treated with multiple PARPi’s. Pattern recognition receptor signaling (Toll and RIG-I)
positively correlated with IFNα, which in turn was associated with R-loops, a surrogate of TRCs
across all models. MTAP/IFNA deletion at 9p21.3 inhibited PARPi activity in patients.

Conclusions:
NERO met its primary endpoint of longer PFS in patients with relapsed mesothelioma. PARPi
response is predicted by IFNα transcription and 9p21.3 deletion status. Multiomic analysis of
NERO is ongoing and will be presented.
NERO is funded by Asthma and Lung UK (MCTA20F\2) with drug supplied by GSK.
