Abstract
Despite its pivotal role in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), oncogenic Kras has eluded
pharmacological targeting design, albeit with more recent and promising development. Given the
preponderance of KrasG12D mutation in PDAC, we engineered exosomes from allogenic bone
marrow derived mesenchymal cells with incorporation of KrasG12DsiRNA payload. We report on a
comprehensive preclinical toxicology and biodistribution analysis of clinical grade iExosomes in
mice and rhesus macaques, which informed on their safety as therapeutic agents in patients. We
report on the clinical testing of iExosomes in a Phase 1 study that employed a classical 3+3 dose
escalation design. Patients with metastatic disease were enrolled after multiple lines of therapy
failure. No dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were encountered for all 3 dose levels tested, and no
DLT were noted for the 3 of the 9 patients who had stable disease after completing the first 3
cycles and allowed to undergo an additional 3 consecutive cycles. A follow up accelerated dose
titration trial enrolled an additional 3 patients. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached,
with no DLT encountered at the highest dosage used. Stable disease of target lesions was
observed in 6 of the 12 patients treated with iExosomes, permitting their enrollment in additional
iExosomes doses, with no DLT encountered. All patients eventually demonstrated PD. Target
engagement was studied with down regulation of circulating KrasG12D DNA and pre- and postbiopsy tissue analysis for Kras signaling. Immune profiling revealed opportunistic synergy with
immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Murine studies confirmed synergy of iExosomes with antiCTLA4 antibodies specifically, with iExosomes reprograming the tumor immune
microenvironment and recruiting Tregs susceptible to anti-CTLA4 co-treatment. This trial is the
