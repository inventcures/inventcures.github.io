Abstract
Background:
Replication stress (RS) is a critical cancer vulnerability. ART0380 is an inhibitor of AtaxiaTelangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR), the primary orchestrator of the cellular response to RS.
This is the first clinical report of a development approach wherein tumor cells experience a triple
combination of biological insults: induced RS by irinotecan, endogenous RS via ataxiatelangiectasia mutated (ATM) loss, and prevention of rescue from RS by ATR inhibition
(NCT04657068).

Methods:
Patients (pts) with advanced cancers who had no satisfactory alternative treatment option
received escalating doses of ART0380 (25mg to 400mg) on days 1-3 and 8-10 in combination
with low dose irinotecan (60mg/m2 or 85mg/m2) on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. Pts in dose
expansion were selected based on ATM protein expression. Key objectives included safety,
tolerability, and preliminary efficacy.

Results:
At the data cut-off (01Nov24), 87 patients were dosed with ART0380 + irinotecan. The
recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) was established as 200mg ART0380 on days 1-3 and 8-10

and 60mg/m2 irinotecan on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. At the RP2D (N=58), the median
prior lines of therapy was 3 (range 1-7) with 59% of pts receiving prior irinotecan. The most
common treatment related adverse events were neutropenia (53%), anemia (41%), fatigue

(33%) and diarrhea (31%). Grade≥3 related diarrhea, nausea and vomiting each occurred in 1 pt.
By intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis, the confirmed objective response rate (ORR) was higher in pts
with ATM protein loss by immunohistochemistry compared to those with tumors that expressed
ATM protein (see Table 1). Further analyses with longer follow-up will be available for conference
presentation.

Conclusions:
ART0380 and low dose irinotecan is well tolerated and suitable for long-term dosing. Clinically
meaningful activity has been demonstrated and further refined via biomarker selection (45%
confirmed RECIST response rate in patients with ATM negative cancers).
