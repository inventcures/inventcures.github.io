Abstract
Background:
Given the dramatic rise in incidence of colorectal cancer in young adults, there remain limited
treatment options effective in metastatic disease. Although T cell-based therapies have been
successful in treating highly antigenic cancers, like melanoma and lung, they have not yet been
shown to induce consistent and durable tumor regression in common epithelial malignancies,
including metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). CISH (Cytokine inducible SH2 containing
protein) is a novel intracellular checkpoint target demonstrating PD-L1 ligand independent
mechanisms of enhanced anti-cancer activity. Given that CISH is not currently tractable via
antibody or small molecule drug modalities, we employed CRISPR for precise inhibition of CISH
in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Here, we provide the first clinical report of safety and
anti-tumor activity of CISH edited TILs in 12 patients with metastatic gastrointestinal cancers
(NCT04426669), including a clinical complete response (CR) in a young-adult patient with
immunotherapy-refractory mCRC.

Methods:
Tumors were surgically resected for TIL harvest, followed by a rapid expansion protocol and

(cyclophosphamide & fludarabine) followed by high-dose IL-2. To establish mechanistic
attribution of the CR, we used iR-RepSeq+ for serial analysis of the TCR immune repertoire.

Results:
Our CRISPR engineering led to KO of CISH in T cells with high-efficiency (>90%) without
detectable off-target editing. We safely dosed patients at all five dose levels (range: 1.91e 8 to
9.93e10 cells). No dose-limiting toxicities attributable to the CISH-KO TIL product were observed.
Adverse events were consistent with established risks of LD chemotherapy, IL-2, or disease
progression. A durable ongoing complete response (>21 months) was achieved in a patient with
microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) mCRC refractory to anti-PD1/CTLA-4 combination therapy.

Conclusions:
We provide the first clinical report of CISH checkpoint targeting via genetically modified T cell
therapy, with complete response in a patient with mCRC. Persistence and expansion of unique
TCR clonotypes detected in neoantigen responsive TIL was temporally consistent with spikes in
CISH edited alleles detected by NGS assay; in the patient with CR, four of the clonotypes
exhibiting prolonged persistence greater than one-year post-infusion exhibited significantly
reduced or undetectable expression of CISH compared to the total infused TIL population. Given
these findings, further investigation of CISH checkpoint inhibition, via gene and cell therapy, and
next-generation small molecule drugging modalities, is underway.
