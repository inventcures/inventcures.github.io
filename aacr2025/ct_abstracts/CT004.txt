Abstract
Background:
Early data suggest poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi)/anti-PD-[L]1 synergy in
homologous recombination repair-mutated (HRRm) or homologous recombination deficient
(HRD) cancers. KEYLYNK-007 (NCT04123366) is a tumor-agnostic trial that evaluated the
PARPi olaparib plus pembrolizumab in HRRm/HRD advanced tumors.

Methods:
This phase 2 trial enrolled participants (pts) with HRRm or HRD+ advanced solid tumors to 3
cohorts: BRCAm (except breast and ovarian), non-BRCA HRRm, and non-HRRm HRD.
HRRm/HRD was centrally confirmed using the Lynparza HRR-HRD Assay before treatment with
300 mg olaparib BID + 200 mg pembrolizumab Q3W (≤35 cycles). Primary endpoint was ORR
per RECIST 1.1 by central review. Secondary endpoints were duration of response and PFS per
RECIST 1.1 by central review, OS, and safety.

Results:
At data cutoff (May 16, 2024), 332 pts were enrolled (n = 132 [BRCAm], n = 104 [non-BRCA
HRRm], n = 96 [non-HRRm HRD]) (Table). Median follow-up was 13.4 (BRCAm), 10.4 (nonSkip

HRRm),
and 10.8 months (non-HRRm HRD). ORR was 27% (BRCAm), 12% (non-BRCA
HRRm), and 12% (non-HRRm HRD). Confirmed RECIST 1.1 responders beyond PARPiapproved indications included pts with advanced breast, ovarian, pancreatic, urothelial, renal,

biliary, cervical, esophageal SCC, CRC, gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma, duodenal, small
intestine, thyroid, salivary gland, HNSCC, NSCLC, SCLC, leiomyosarcoma, and other sarcomas.
There were also multiple responses in HRRm prostate cancer. Grade ≥3 drug-related adverse
events occurred in 30% pts; 1/332 (0.3%) pt died from septic shock.

Conclusions:
In this tumor-agnostic trial, olaparib plus pembrolizumab showed promising durable antitumor
activity and manageable safety in HRRm and HRD+ (particularly BRCAm) advanced cancers
beyond currently approved indications. Biomarker analysis is ongoing for other predictive
biomarkers of response.
