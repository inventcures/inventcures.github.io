Abstract
Background:
SYS6010 is a novel ADC comprising of an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody conjugated to topoisomerase I inhibitor JS-1 via a
cleavable glycine̶̶-glycine-phenylalanine-glycine tetrapeptide linker.

Methods:
This multicenter, open-label, phase 1 study evaluated the safety, tolerability and preliminary
efficacy of SYS6010 in patients with advanced solid tumors who had failed or were intolerant to
standard treatment. The study consisted of two parts, dose escalation, PK expansion (part 1)
and dose expansion (part 2), part 1 used a 3+3 dose-escalation design with six dose levels of
SYS6010 (0.6, 1.8, 3.6, 4.8, 5.6 and 6.4 mg/kg) administered intravenously every 3 weeks and
PK expansion. Part 2 was dose expansion at effective doses identified in part 1. The primary
endpoints were safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose
(RP2D).

Results:
As of December 26, 2024, 232 patients received ≥ 1 dose of SYS6010. Most frequent cancer
type was non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, n=137). The median (range) prior anti-cancer drug

therapy regimen was 3 (1-11). One dose-limiting toxicity (grade 4 thrombocytopenia) occurred at
6.4 mg/kg. MTD was not reached. 213 (91.8%) patients had treatment-related adverse events
(TRAEs) with ≥ grade 3 TRAEs at 47%. The most common (all grade/≥ grade 3) TRAEs were

leukopenia (47.8%/20.7%), anemia (46.1%/7.3%), nausea (46.1%/0.9%), thrombocytopenia
(44.8%/13.8%), neutropenia (42.7%/23.7%), decreased appetite (41.8%/1.7%), asthenia
(41.8%/2.2%), vomiting (33.2%/1.3%), rash (26.3%/0.4%), and alopecia (22.8%/0%). 174
patients were efficacy evaluable. The objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate
(DCR) were 32.8% (95% CI 25.85-40.27) and 86.2% (95% CI 80.18-90.96), respectively. The
ORR and DCR in ≥ 4.8 mg/kg groups were 39.1% (45/115) and 78.3% (90/115), respectively.
The ORR and DCR in ≥ 4.8 mg/kg groups in EGFR-mutant nonsquamous NSCLC (nsq-NSCLC)
were 50% (27/52) and 92.3% (48/52), respectively. In the EGFR-mutant NSCLC subjects who
failed prior EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the ORR and DCR were 90% (9/10) and
100% (10/10), respectively, and the ORR and DCR were 41.5% (17/41) and 90.2% (37/41) for
those who failed prior EGFR TKI as well as a platinum-based chemotherapy. In EGFR wild-type
nsq-NSCLC patients who failed both immunotherapy and chemotherapy, the ORR and DCR
were 50% (3/6) and 83.3% (5/6) in ≥ 4.8 mg/kg groups, respectively. The Cmax and AUC of JS-1
were significantly lower than those of ADC and total antibody, indicating SYS6010 was stable in
the circulation. The Cmax and AUC of ADC increased linearly with doses ranging from 0.6 to 6.4
mg/kg.

Conclusions:
SYS6010 demonstrated a tolerable safety profile with promising efficacy in patients with
advanced solid tumors, particularly in nsq-NSCLC subjects with EGFR TKI resistance or EGFR
wild type.
