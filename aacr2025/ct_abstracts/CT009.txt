Abstract
Background:
SHR-A1811 is a novel ADC consisting of a humanized HER2-directed monoclonal antibody,
cleavable tetrapeptide-based linker, and DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor. We conducted a
multicenter, open-label, phase 1/2 study to evaluate SHR-A1811 in HER2-altered NSCLC. In the
registrational phase 2 portion in patients (pts) with HER2-mutant NSCLC, the primary endpoint of
IRC-assessed ORR was met (DCO, Jun. 14, 2024). Here, we presented an updated analysis
after an additional 6-mo follow-up, focusing on survival outcomes.

Methods:
Pts with advanced NSCLC and centrally confirmed HER2 mutation, previously treated with (or
intolerance to) platinum-based chemo and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, were enrolled. SHR-A1811
was administered at 4.8 mg/kg IV Q3W.

Results:
94 pts were enrolled and treated. Median prior lines of therapy was 2 (range 1-9); all received
platinum-based chemo and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy and 23.4% received anti-HER2 TKI. 25.5%
had BM at baseline. The most common HER2 mutation was exon 20 insertions (overall, 94.7%;
A775_G776insYVMA, 72.3%). As of DCO (Dec. 14, 2024), median follow-up was 14.2 mo (range
4.7-18.2). Per IRC, ORR was 74.5% (95% CI 64.4-82.9); median DoR was 9.8 mo (95% CI 8.3Skip to Main Content
13.9). Median PFS was 11.5 mo (95% CI 9.7-15.2), with consistent benefits observed across
baseline subgroups (Table 1). Efficacy per INV is shown in Table 1. Median OS was not
reached; 12-mo OS rate was 88.2% (95% CI 79.8-93.3). Grade ≥3 TRAEs occurred in 63

(67.0%) pts; all with incidence ≥5% were haematological toxicities. ILD occurred in 8 (8.5%;
grade 1-2, n=7; grade 3, n=1) pts. TRAEs led to dose discontinuation in 2 (2.1%) pts. There was
no treatment-related death.

Conclusions:
At the updated analysis, SHR-A1811 continued to show clinically meaningful efficacy with a
manageable safety profile in pts with previously treated HER2-mutant NSCLC, supporting it as a
potential new treatment option for this population.
