The phase 3 ClarIDHY trial demonstrated that the mIDH1 inhibitor ivosidenib (IVO) improved progression-free survival in CCA patients who have progressed from first or second-line chemotherapy and who have activating mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (mIDH1). Additionally, mIDH1 suppresses key immune-related genes, with reversal of this effect when mIDH1 inhibitors are administered in preclinical CCA models. Finally, encouraging activity has been observed in treatment-naive mIDH1 patients administered with the mIDH1 inhibitor LY3410738 in combination with GEM/CIS. Given the ability of ivosidenib to stabilize advanced CCA, ability of IDH1 inhibition to restore immune activity, promising clinical activity of an mIDH1 inhibitor in combination with GEM/CIS, and the limited overlapping toxicities of these treatments, this study seeks to explore safety and preliminary activity of the quadruplet combination.",
