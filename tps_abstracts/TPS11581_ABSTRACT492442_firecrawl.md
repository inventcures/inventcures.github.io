**Background:**

_TP53,_ encoding p53 protein, is one of the most frequently mutated genes across all cancers, with TP53 mutations found in ~59% of all solid tumors. _TP53_ mutations result in the loss of p53 tumor suppressor functions leading to tumor development and progression. The _TP53_ Y220C mutation, occurring in ~1% of all solid tumors, is a missense mutation that destabilizes the p53 protein. Rezatapopt (also known as PC14586) is an investigational, first-in-class, selective, p53 reactivator specific to the _TP53_ Y220C mutation that restores wildtype p53 function. Preliminary findings from Phase 1 part of the PYNNACLE (NCT04585750) Phase 1/2 study, showed that rezatapopt had a favorable safety profile and single-agent efficacy in heavily pre-treated patients with solid tumors harboring a _TP53_ Y220C mutation ( _Schram A, AACR-NCI-EORTC 2023, LBA25_). Here we describe the study design for the registrational Phase 2 part of the PYNNACLE study.

**Methods:**

The Phase 2 part of PYNNACLE is an ongoing, global, single-arm, open-label, multicenter basket trial in patients with solid tumors harboring a _TP53_ Y220C mutation (Table). Patients must have measurable disease at baseline, ECOG performance status 0 or 1, and adequate organ function; other key inclusion criteria are listed in the table. Patients with _KRAS_ single nucleotide variants, primary CNS tumors and unstable brain metastases are excluded. Eligible patients receive rezatapopt 2000mg, orally, once daily, taken with food, for continuous 21-day cycles. Patients are followed until death, lost to follow-up, two years after last patient discontinuation, or end of study. As of March 2024, ≈114 patients are planned to be enrolled.
