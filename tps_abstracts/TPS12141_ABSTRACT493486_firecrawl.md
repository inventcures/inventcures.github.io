# A randomized phase III study comparing stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) versus conventional palliative radiotherapy (CRT) for participants with painful non-spine bone metastases (NCT06391242).

**Background:** Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is efficacious in the treatment of painful spinal metastases \[1\]. Data are required regarding the efficacy feasibility, toxicity and clinical outcomes associated with SBRT in patients with painful non-spine bone metastases prior to widespread adoption of this technique.

**Methods:** This is a Canadian Cancer Trials Group led multi-centre, phase III randomized controlled trial comparing SBRT to conventional palliative external beam radiotherapy (CRT) in patients with solid tumours and a dominant painful non-spine bone metastasis (worst pain score >2).

_Treatment arms:_ EBRT 20Gy/5fr (control) versus SBRT 35 Gy/5fr or 30Gy/5fr (experimental).

_Primary objective_: To compare 3-month complete pain response (CPR) rate and analgesic intake assessed using the International Consensus on Palliative Radiotherapy Endpoints \[2\]. Secondary objectives evaluate pain response pattern at 1, 3 and 6 months and assess re-irradiation rates, fracture incidence within RT target site, incidence of Grade > 2 adverse events, image-based local control, and patient reported outcomes (EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BM22).

_Statistical design:_ The target accrual is 230 patients, randomized 1:1. The trial is powered at 80% with a two-sided alpha of 0.05 to detect an improvement in the CPR rate from 17% (CRT) to 34% (SBRT), accounting for a 15% missing data rate.

_Conduct to Date_ **:** Study was activated on June 26, 2024.

Supported by CCS grant # 707213.
