# VERSATILE-003: A phase 3, randomized, open-label trial of PDS0101 and pembrolizumab compared with pembrolizumab for first-line treatment of patients with HPV16-positive recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

**Background:**

Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has surpassed cervical cancer as the most common HPV-related cancer in the US, with the majority being caused by HPV16. Persistent expression of HPV16 oncoproteins E6 and E7 by host genome may promote HNSCC. HPV16-positive HNSCC may be associated with poor clinical outcomes in the recurrent/metastatic (R/M) setting. PDS0101 (Versamune HPV) is an HPV16-immunotherapy that generates a potent, targeted T cell attack against HPV16 E6 & E7. In a Phase 2 study, PDS0101 plus pembrolizumab has shown encouraging safety and survival benefit in patients with HPV16-positive R/M HNSCC. (Weiss J et al. ESMO 2024. Poster 879P. NCT04260126).

**Methods:**

VERSATILE-003 is a global Phase 3, randomized, controlled, open-label study evaluating PDS0101 plus pembrolizumab vs. pembrolizumab in patients with HPV16-positive R/M HNSCC with PD-L1 positive disease (CPS ≥1). Key eligibility criteria include age ≥18-years-old, histologically- or cytologically-confirmed diagnosis of R/M HNSCC with primary tumor location of oropharynx, oral cavity, hypopharynx, or larynx and no prior systemic anticancer treatment in the R/M setting, HPV16 tumor positivity (centrally tested), PD-L1 positivity defined as CPS ≥ 1 using FDA-approved PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit, and measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1 confirmed by blinded independent central review (BICR).

Patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3W with PDS0101 1 mL SC administered concurrently during Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, and 12 (investigational arm), or pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3W alone (control arm). The primary objective is to compare overall survival (OS) between the investigational and control arms. Secondary objectives include objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DOR), and progression-free survival (PFS) using RECIST 1.1 and assessed by BICR. Exploratory objectives include tumor response assessed by investigator and by irRECIST, PFS2, quality of life as assessed by EQ-5D, QLQ-C30, and QLQ H&N35, and assessment of ctHPVDNA. Updated enrollment data will be provided.
