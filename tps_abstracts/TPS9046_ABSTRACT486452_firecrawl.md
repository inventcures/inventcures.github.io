# A randomized controlled trial of high-fidelity simulation versus mentoring training for residents: ACACIAS 2.

**Background:**

In medical oncology, the "know-how-to-be" aspect of training is crucial but often underemphasized in resident education. Typically, residents develop their interpersonal skills through direct patient interactions. The challenge lies in delivering cancer diagnoses with empathy and effectively managing the patient experience through advanced communication strategies. High-fidelity simulation training has proven effective in educating professionals, including those in surgical fields. Our previous feasibility studies established a simulation framework for cancer consultation processes. This study aims to demonstrate that high-fidelity simulation training provides greater benefits for residents compared to traditional mentoring by reducing perceived stress levels.

**Methods:**

ACACIA2 ( _n° HDH :_ F20221011092723) is a prospective, randomized, open-label, national, multicenter trial that aims to enroll 100 young doctors. After one high-fidelity simulation evaluation, they were randomly assigned (1:1) to have traditional mentoring (Arm A or control arm)+/- 2 sessions of high-fidelity simulation with theoretical training with a certified coach/actor (Arm B) during 6 months. This training adapted to the announcement has been validated in preliminary studies (ACACIA programme)(Figure 1). All the cases worked on in the sessions are taken from real life. Inclusion criteria include healthcare professionals aged 18 and older, actively participating in specialties where they frequently deliver cancer diagnoses, such as surgical and medical disciplines. The primary endpoint is to compare changes in stress levels between residents receiving simulation training and those undergoing conventional mentoring. Secondary objectives include assessing stress changes as measured by a coach/actor, evaluating self-assessed attitudes and skills during simulation sessions, comparing self-assessments before and after training, monitoring heart rate variability, exploring the relationship between skill development and heart rate changes, and assessing participant satisfaction. The first resident was enrolled in November 2022.
