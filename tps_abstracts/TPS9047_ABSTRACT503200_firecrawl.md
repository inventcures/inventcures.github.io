**Background:**

The first clinic visit is a pivotal step in the journey of a cancer patient (pt), often accompanied by anxiety due to future uncertainty. During this initial visit, pts receive extensive information regarding their diagnosis, treatment plan and prognosis. Early education and tailored guidance can potentially enhance understanding, aid decision-making, and alleviate distress. This study evaluates the impact of sarcoma-specific educational videos on improving pts’ knowledge of their disease and treatment options _before their first clinic appointment_. Results will help to identify ways to enhance pt education and satisfaction.

**Methods:**

All newly diagnosed, English speaking, sarcoma pts referred to the sarcoma medical oncology clinic at Mount Sinai Hospital and Princess Margaret Cancer Centre will be eligible. The primary objective is to assess changes in pts’ and caregivers’ knowledge and perceptions of sarcoma and its treatment after educational intervention as measured by changes in global responses between baseline and post educational intervention surveys. Secondary endpoints include understandability and satisfaction with the educational videos, using validated tools including Pt Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT) and Suitability Assessment of Materials (SAM) instrument. A pilot study (n = 20) will first be performed to assess feasibility, acceptability and determine sample size. For the interventional study, pts will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to either view the educational videos prior to their consult, or a control arm where they will receive standard of care information. Pts on the experimental arm will view four short educational videos (approximately 5-7 minutes each) which focus on 1) what to expect at their initial visit, 2) sarcoma team composition and respective roles, 3) systemic therapy overview and 4) introduction to clinical trials. The study will involve distribution of surveys at 3 different timepoints, each consisting of 15-20 multiple choice questions and taking 3-5 minutes to complete. The first baseline survey will be completed by pts in both arms before their initial consult and is designed to assess pts’ initial knowledge and perceptions of their sarcoma and treatment options. The second survey, to be completed only by pts on the experimental arm after watching the educational videos, will measure changes in pts’ perceptions and overall satisfaction. A third and final survey will be completed by pts in both arms after their initial consult with the medical oncologist to assess for any further changes. A knowledge quiz will also be given to the pts on the experimental arm both before and after they watch the educational videos to evaluate changes in their understanding of sarcoma and its management. If pts are accompanied by a caregiver, they will also be invited to participate in this study.
